```powershell
iwr -useb https://raw.githubusercontent.com/meohunterr/MeoBoost/main/run.ps1 -OutFile run.ps1; .\run.ps1
```

### Option 2: Manual Installation
For users who prefer to review the code first.

cd MeoBoost

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run the optimizer
python main.py
```

## 🔒 Security

MeoBoost is built with **Transparency** and **Safety** in mind.

- **Zero False Positives**: We do not use compiled `.exe` files (which often trigger false antivirus alerts).
- **Open Source**: Every line of code is visible. You can audit exactly what the tool does.
- **Native APIs**: We use native Windows APIs and PowerShell commands instead of bundling suspicious third-party binaries.
